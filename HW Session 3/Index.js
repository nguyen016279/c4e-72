Swapping variable is to exchange the values of two variable so that at the end, one
variable contains the value of the other

/*Ex8: You are a shepherd who owns a flock of sheep
1. Create an array to represent the sizes of your flock, and log all of your flock size,
expected screen output:

const sheeps = [5,7,300,90,24,75]
console.log('Hell, my name is nguyen and here is my sheep sizes:')
console.log(sheeps)

2. At the end of each month, you have to choose one and only one sheep to shear
and thus you want to choose the biggest one to maximize your profit. Add scripts
to search for the biggest sheep in your list:

const sheeps = [5,7,300,90,24,75]

console.log(sheeps)
maxSheep = Math.max.apply(Math,sheeps)
console.log(`Now my biggest sheep has size ${maxSheep}, let's shave it`);

3. When your biggest sheer, its size will return to the default size, which is 8.

console.log('Hell, my name is nguyen and here is my sheep sizes:')
console.log(sheeps)

4. In the following month, EVERY sheep in your flock grow, they have their size
increased by 50. Log them out
